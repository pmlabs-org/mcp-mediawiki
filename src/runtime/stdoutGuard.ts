/**
 * Under the stdio transport, stdout carries the JSON-RPC frames and nothing
 * else: one stray line makes the client fail to parse a message. mwn writes its
 * own diagnostics there by default — a successful login, an API warning, a
 * retry — each prefixed with a bracketed timestamp, which a client reports as
 * "Expected ',' or ']' after array element in JSON at position 5".
 *
 * The guard leaves stdout to the transport and routes everything else into the
 * structured stderr log, so operators keep the diagnostics in the same
 * JSON-lines stream as the rest of our output. It covers both transports: on
 * HTTP nothing owns stdout, but raw text there is still invisible to a log
 * pipeline that parses each line as JSON.
